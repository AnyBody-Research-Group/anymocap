The AnyMoCap Framework
######################

.. note::  The AnyMoCap model is now `part of the AMMR <https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/anymocap.html>`__. 
   So there is no more need to use this repository unless you rely on modifing the AnyMoCap implemenation. 

The AnyMoCap model is an effort to create a simple and unified framework for
doing any kind of mocap analysis with the `AnyBody Modeling
System <http://anybodytech.com>`__.
