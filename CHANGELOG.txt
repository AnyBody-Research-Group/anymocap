Current development
===================


* AnyMoCap: New argument ``DRAW_SCALE`` in the ``CreateMarkerDriver`` template to control the visual size of markers.

* Update the MoCap Multi trial example ``Plug-in-gait_MultiTrial_StandingRef`` to make it better starting point for creating new models.

  * Moved the Human-Ground residuals from the Trunk to the Pelvis segment. 
  * Use the TLEM 2 lower body model in the example. 
  * Disable upper bounds for the muscle recruitment ``Criterion.UpperBoundOnOff = Off;`` to improve the stability of the simulations. 
  
* Fix bug in ``CreateMarkerDriver``  class template which prevented the ``UseC3DWeightResiduals`` from having any effect.

* BVH example is updated: 

  * The example now uses its own BVH settings file instead of the default file
    in the AnyMoCap folder

  * Pre-processing the BVH data is now a separate operation which saves the
    vitual marker positions to a file. Thus, this step can be skipped the next
    time the model is reloaded.
