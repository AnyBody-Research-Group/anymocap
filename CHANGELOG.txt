Current development
===================


* AnyMoCap: New argument ``DRAW_SCALE`` in the ``CreateMarkerDriver`` template to control the visual size of markers.

* Update the MoCap Multi trial example ``Plug-in-gait_MultiTrial_StandingRef`` to make it better starting point for creating new models.

  * Moved the Human-Ground residuals from the Trunk to the Pelvis segment. 
  * Use the TLEM 2 lower body model in the example. 
  * Disable upper bounds for the muscle recruitment ``Criterion.UpperBoundOnOff = Off;`` to improve the stability of the simulations.
