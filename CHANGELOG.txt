Current development
===================


* AnyMoCap: New argument ``DRAW_SCALE`` in the ``CreateMarkerDriver`` template to control the visual size of markers.

* Update the MoCap Multi trial example ``Plug-in-gait_MultiTrial_StandingRef`` to make it better starting point for creating new models.

  * Moved the Human-Ground residuals from the Trunk to the Pelvis segment. 
  * Use the TLEM 2 lower body model in the example. 
  * Disable upper bounds for the muscle recruitment ``Criterion.UpperBoundOnOff = Off;`` to improve the stability of the simulations. 
  
* Fix bug in ``CreateMarkerDriver``  class template which prevented the ``UseC3DWeightResiduals`` from having any effect.

* BVH example is updated: 

  * The example now uses its own BVH settings file instead of the default file
    in the AnyMoCap folder

  * Pre-processing the BVH data is now a separate operation which saves the
    vitual marker positions to a file. Thus, this step can be skipped the next
    time the model is reloaded.
  
* Use the defualt kinematic solver for the InverseDynamic analysis

* Support for using the Shoulder Rhythm with MoCap model. 

* Change the set of joint drivers used for transferring the joint angles from the
  over-determinate marker tracking to the inverse dynamic analysis. Instead of
  Sterno Clavicula Elevation the Scapula Thorax Elevation is used to make the 
  the kinematics of scapula more robust in the inverse dynamic analysis.
